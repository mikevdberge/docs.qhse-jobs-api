### General Notes <a href="generalnotes" id="generalnotes"></a>

Generic principles regarding the XML files that Adzuna accepts:

#### Delivery <a href="delivery" id="delivery"></a>

The XML file can be made available through a url (it can be password protected) and Adzuna will download it, or alternatively it can be uploaded to Adzuna's FTP server.

To upload a file to Adzuna's FTP server, an IP that Adzuna will whitelist must be provided. The whitelisted IP must be used to upload the XML file and any effort to upload from a non-whitelisted IP will fail.

Adzuna will download the XML file and update the search engine at least once per day, and therefore the file you produce must be updated with at least that frequency.

Compressing the XML file with a well-known compression algorithm like gz or zip is highly preferable.

#### Well-formed XML <a href="well-formedxml" id="well-formedxml"></a>

The XML provided for inclusion must be a well structured and valid XML document. Many freely available tools provide XML validation.

For Linux systems an XML file can be validated with:

```
$ xmllint --noout test.xml
```

#### XML declaration <a href="xmldeclaration" id="xmldeclaration"></a>

The usage of an XML declaration is highly preferable:

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
```

#### File encoding <a href="fileencoding" id="fileencoding"></a>

Data encoded in Unicode is highly preferable. Declaring the encoding of the content data in the XML declaration is also highly preferable.

#### CDATA <a href="cdata" id="cdata"></a>

Adzuna is flexible and accepts XML files both with and without CDATA sections.

If CDATA sections are not used, make sure that the content of the XML tags is properly escaped. Left angle brackets and ampersands may not occur in their literal form and must be escaped using "`&lt;`" and "` &amp;`" ([more details](http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#sec-cdata-sect)).

### XML structure <a href="xmlstructure" id="xmlstructure"></a>

#### Jobs <a href="jobs" id="jobs"></a>

This section describes the structure of a job XML file

**Root Element and job ad**

The root element is `<jobs>` and each ad should be enclosed in a `<job>` tag. Example:

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
<jobs>

    <job>
    ...
    </job>

    <job>
    ...
    </job>

</jobs>
```

**Job ad fields**

| title             | **Mandatory**      | Job title. This should be an actual job title and should not include a location, salary, ID number or any keywords e.g. help wanted, urgent etc. as this will impact search relevancy when Adzuna users are looking for your jobs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
